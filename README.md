# AWS Stop/Start Scheduler â€“ DEV & QA EC2/RDS

## Overview
This project automates **scheduled start/stop of tagged EC2 and RDS instances** in AWS **DEV** and **QA** environments to reduce costs during non-working hours.  
It uses **AWS Lambda**, **Amazon EventBridge**, and **Amazon SNS** for orchestration, notifications, and execution.

## Features
The Scheduler Stop/Start mechanism automates EC2 and RDS instance lifecycle management for DEV and QA environments based on tag-based filtering.
Helps reduce costs by turning off non-critical workloads after business hours.
Tag-driven logic ensures flexibility and control per resource.
Tag used for control:
Scheduler-Stop-Start=YES
